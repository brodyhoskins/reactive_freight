# ReactiveFreight

ReactiveFreight extends [ReactiveShipping](https://github.com/realsubpop/reactive_shipping) to support LTL carriers.

Features specific to ReactiveFreight:

**Important:** The following features require carriers to be defined as a ReactiveFreight carriers specifically; this means that carriers included with ReactiveShipping function the same as before (and do not inherit the features).

- Abstracted accessorials
- Abstracted tracking events
- Cubic feet and density calculations
- Freight class calculations (and manual overriding)
- Download scanned documents including bill of lading and/or proof of delivery where supported

## Supported Freight Carriers & Platforms

*This list varies day to day as this the project is a work in progress*

**In addition** to the carriers supported by [ReactiveShipping](https://github.com/realsubpop/reactive_shipping), ReactiveFreight supports the following carriers and platforms.

Carriers differ from platforms in that they have unique web services whereas platforms host several carriers' web services on a single service (platform).

### Carriers

* [Best Overnite Express](https://www.bestovernite.com)
* [Dependable Highway Express](https://godependable.com)
* [The Custom Companies](https://www.customco.com)
* [Roadrunner Transportation Services](https://www.rrts.com)
* [Western Regional Delivery Service](http://www.wrds.com)

### Platforms

## Versions

[See releases](https://github.com/brodyhoskins/reactive_freight/releases)

## Installation

Using bundler, add to the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'reactive_freight'
```

Or stand alone:

```
$ gem install reactive_freight
```

## Sample Usage

Start off by initializing the carrier:

```ruby
require 'reactive_freight'
carrier = ReactiveShipping::BTVP.new(account: 'account_number',
                                     username: 'username',
                                     password: 'password')
```

### Documents

```ruby
carrier.find_bol(tracking_number)
carrier.find_pod(tracking_number, path: 'POD.pdf') # path is optional
```

### Tracking

**Important:** When a ReactiveFreight carrier is loaded `ReactiveShipping::ShipmentEvent` objects' `name` and `status` will return symbols rather than text â€” it is up to higher-level libraries to provide translations.

Carriers included with ReactiveShipping (typically non-freight) will retain the original behavior for compatibility.

```ruby
tracking = carrier.find_tracking_info(tracking_number)

tracking.delivered?
tracking.status

tracking_info.shipment_events.each do |event|
  puts "#{event.name} at #{event.location.city}, #{event.location.state} on #{event.time}. #{event.message}"
end
```

### Quoting

```ruby
packages = [
  ReactiveShipping::Package.new(371 * 16,            # 371 lbs
                                [40, 48, 47],        # inches
                                units: :imperial),
  ReactiveShipping::Package.new(371 * 16,            # 371 lbs
                                [40, 48, 47],        # inches
                                freight_class: 125,  # override calculated freight class
                                units: :imperial)
]

origin = ReactiveShipping::Location.new(country: 'US',
                                        state: 'CA',
                                        city: 'Los Angeles',
                                        zip: '90001')

destination = ReactiveShipping::Location.new(country: 'US',
                                             state: 'IL',
                                             city: 'Chicago',
                                             zip: '60007')

accessorials = %i[
  appointment_delivery
  liftgate_delivery
  residential_delivery
]

response = carrier.find_rates(origin, destination, packages, accessorials: accessorials)
rates = response.rates
rates = response.rates.sort_by(&:price).collect { |rate| [rate.service_name, rate.price] }
```

Dimensions for packages are in `Height x Width x Length` order.
